Plugin enables to go dark on protest days, like the world day against cyber-
censorship 2013 

== Description ==

Displays a black day with a notice. 
As default it shows a (german) protest notice by the Pirate Party Germany 
about the world day against cyber-censorship 2013 (as invoked by Reporter 
Without Borders, http://en.rsf.org/).
It wont forbit the access to the website. Users can close it and continue 
reading.

A cookie will be set for users after they saw the notice the first time. This
will prevent them to get spamed by the notice every time they come back
at the same day.

Within the backend options this plugin can be used for other protest days also.
